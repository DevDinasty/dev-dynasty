# dev-dynasty

DevDynasty is a group of developers excited to build a 2D educational game.

The game was born by a college project, and is inspirated by RPG medieval games, like Knights II and RuneScape, but in a educational way.

In this game the goal is to defeat monsters while solving mathematic problems and exercises the logical reasoning.
